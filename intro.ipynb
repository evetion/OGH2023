We want a language that's homoiconic, with true macros like Lisp, but with obvious, familiar mathematical notation like Matlab. We want something as usable for general programming as Python, as easy for statistics as R, as natural for string processing as Perl, as powerful for linear algebra as Matlab, as good at gluing programs together as the shell. Something that is dirt simple to learn, yet keeps the most serious hackers happy. We want it interactive and we want it compiled."

We do not propose you dump Python, Matlab, Fortran or C++ now (well, maybe Matlab). As described above, we think the clear use case for Julia is technical computing. Domain specific programs that require High Performance Computing (HPC).\n",
